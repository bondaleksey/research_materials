# Research materials

Here you can find materials(slides, papers, theses) which represent part of my previous work

 - **fault_tolerance**: some researches about fault tolerance parallel computations in HPC prone to failure,
 - **banded_matrix**: my thesis about some type of deference equations, which can be used in parallel computations for eigenvalue problem of banded matrices,
 - **visualization_tool**:  implement a parallel algorithm for constructing isolines and isosurfaces,
 - **differential_evolution**: parallel implementation of differential evolution methods,
 - **QRE_game_theory**: interests in game theory and its algorithms.
